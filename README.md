# ROC_Shiny_App

This shiny app allows the user to visually see how the distribution of positive and negative classes impacts the area under the receiver operator curve (ROC).

The Area Under Curve (AUC) measure is used to evaluate how well a binary classifier distinguishes between classes at various thresholds. 
The better the classifier separates the classes (as illustrated by the distributions), the higher the AUC.
